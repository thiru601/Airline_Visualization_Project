# Airline_Visualization_Project

Airline Route Visualizatio Project for Predictive Modeling 

Visuals provide information on delays to the top 5 destinations from the Austin International Airport (AUS) in 2008. 

Visual story telling part 2: flights at ABIA

Consider the data in ABIA.csv, which contains information on every commercial flight in 2008 that either departed from or landed at Austin-Bergstrom Interational Airport. The variable codebook is as follows:

Year all 2008

Month 1-12

DayofMonth 1-31

DayOfWeek 1 (Monday) - 7 (Sunday)

DepTime actual departure time (local, hhmm)

CRSDepTime scheduled departure time (local, hhmm)

ArrTime actual arrival time (local, hhmm)

CRSArrTime scheduled arrival time (local, hhmm)

UniqueCarrier unique carrier code

FlightNum flight number

Cancelled was the flight cancelled?

Your task is to create a figure, or set of related figures, that tell an interesting story about flights into and out of Austin. You can annotate the figure and briefly describe it, but strive to make it as stand-alone as possible. It shouldn't need many, many paragraphs to convey its meaning. Rather, the figure should speak for itself as far as possible.

You have broad freedom to look at any variables you'd like here -- try to find that sweet spot where you're showing genuinely interesting relationships among more than just two variables, but where the resulting figure or set of figures doesn't become overwhelming/confusing. (Faceting/panel plots might be especially useful here.) If you want to try your hand at mapping, you can find coordinates for the airport codes here: https://github.com/datasets/airport-codes. Combine this with a mapping package like ggmap, and you should have lots of possibilities!
